Download all images into one folder
Try to standardize file names so they have the same format, to make them easier to operate on (I had to do some manually - don't trust the script I wrote for that blindly - it helps, but is not 100% perfect yet)
Delete any patients that don't have images of all 3 strains
For the patients with multiple copies of the same strain (e.g. patient X has 3 copies of the h&e strain image) then keep the one with the highest resolution
Then use a combination of Noah's cropping algorithm & Cara's automation to extract slices from each image
Then go through the slices (there were a lot of errors - missing slices, too many slices, too few slices etc.) and remove the lowest quality ones (smallest file size) and then manually go through the rest and check for errors (again, there were so many errors)
Then split up by patient into folders (filename: patientID_strainType_"slice"_number)
Then go through the images and create subfolders with matching 3 images
And delete the rest of the images as they aren't needed
Some other issues I noticed:

patient h1845484 can't extract slices using either Noah or Cara's code for h&e
patient h1857578A is missing 1 slice from h&e which was probably dropped because of low file size(?)
patient h1942528 can't extract slices from all 3 strains
patient h2114161 has bars across image for sox10
patient h2114162 is missing all slices
patient h2114163 is missing melan slice
patient h2114164 is missing 2 slices for h&e, all for melan, one slice for sox10
patient h2114165 is missing 2 slices for h&e and all for melan and sox10
patient h2114166 is missing slices for melan and sox10, one slice has gray bars through it for h&e
patient h2114167 did not extract slices
patient h2114168 I'm unsure if the extracted slices are correct or just parts of a whole
patient h2114169 missing melan slice
patient h2114170 missing melan and sox10 slices
patient h2114171 missing sox10 slices
patient h2114172 missing sox10 slices
patient h2114179 missing sox10 slices
patient h2114180 missing sox10 slices
patient h2114181 has some split slices h&e and one slice has a black line through it
patient h2114188 missing a slice from h&e, missing 2 from melan, all from sox10
