Annie’s code is designed to analyze tissue scan images for each patient and identify the best match
across three different staining types—H&E, melan (melanin), and Sox. The main objective is to find
the optimal combination of one image from each stain type that has the highest overall similarity in shape.
This similarity is computed by extracting the primary contours from each image and calculating shape similarity
scores for each combination. The code then averages the similarity scores between the three image pairings to
get an overall similarity score for each combination, which allows it to determine the best-matching trio of images for each patient.

To use the code, place the patient folders containing tissue scan images into a specified directory 
(e.g., images/). Each folder should contain images labeled by staining type—H&E, melan, or Sox. 
You’ll also need to set the path to this directory in the code. The code reads the images from each patient folder,
calculates the contour similarity scores, and then outputs the filenames and similarity scores of the best three-way
image match for each patient. The best-matching images are displayed in a side-by-side format, and the similarity
score for each patient folder is printed in the output for easy comparison.
