# Tissue Image Analysis

This method is designed to analyze tissue images, focusing on identifying and quantifying purple-stained regions. The analysis begins by generating an epithelium mask to isolate tissue regions using contour detection. The input image is preprocessed through grayscale conversion, blurring, and thresholding to create a binary mask. Morphological operations refine this mask by smoothing edges and removing noise, while contours outlining the epithelium are extracted and drawn on the original image, creating a clear visual distinction of the tissue region.

Following this, superpixel segmentation uses color and texture similarity to divide the image into smaller segments. Each segment is analyzed for purple concentration based on defined HSV color thresholds, which allows for consistent analysis across varying lighting conditions. Regions with high staining concentration retain their original color, moderate concentrations are marked in white, and low concentrations in black, emphasizing tissue areas by staining intensity.
