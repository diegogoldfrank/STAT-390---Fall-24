## README for Luna's epithelium detection algorithm (Week 4)

Luna worked on generalizing Eli's code from last week in many different ways. 

## Process
Tried to generalize the kernel size to make the code more dynamic, but was unsuccessful. She also tried Otsu's threshold with Eli's grayscale images and selecting the biggest 2/3/5 contours or cutting off the contour list where the area dip to be less than 10% of the previous contour. Afterward, she repeated all of these for LAB images. 

## Takeaways
Grayscale definitely work better than LAB and Otsu's is promising. The idea of sorting the contours by area and cutting off by 10% is not very applicable as the contours decreases in size more gradually then we think so it ends up overselecting for a lot of the images. The idea of selecting the biggest 2 or 3 contours seems to work the best and there doesn't seem to be a big difference in the efficiency between these two methods.
