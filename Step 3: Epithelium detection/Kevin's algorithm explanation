This method is designed to analyze tissue images, focusing on identifying and quantifying purple-stained regions.
The process begins with generating an epithelium mask to isolate tissue regions using contour detection. 
The input image is preprocessed through grayscale conversion, blurring, and thresholding to create a binary mask. 
Morphological operations help refine this mask by smoothing edges and removing noise. Contours outlining the epithelium are then extracted and drawn on the original image, creating a
clear visual distinction of the tissue region. The next step, superpixel segmentation, uses color and texture similarity
to divide the image into smaller segments. Each segment is analyzed for purple concentration based on defined HSV color thresholds,
allowing a more consistent analysis across lighting variations. Regions with high staining concentration retain their original
color, moderate concentrations are marked in white, and low concentrations in black, emphasizing tissue areas by staining intensity.
