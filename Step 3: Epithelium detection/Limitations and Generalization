Limitations:

While this method effectively highlights stained regions, it has some limitations. 
It relies on specific threshold and morphological settings, which may need adjustment for different images.
Variations in lighting or stain intensity can also affect results, requiring color threshold adjustments. 
Additionally, the code is not fully developed for handling outside regions and struggles with overlapping
tissue areas where superpixels may blend inside and outside regions. Expanding these capabilities would 
improve its effectiveness across a wider range of tissue samples.
