This method is designed to analyze tissue images, focusing on identifying and quantifying purple-stained regions,
commonly used to highlight specific tissue markers or characteristics. The process begins with generating an epithelium
mask to isolate tissue regions using contour detection. The input image is preprocessed through grayscale conversion,
blurring, and thresholding to create a binary mask. Morphological operations help refine this mask by smoothing edges
and removing noise. Contours outlining the epithelium are then extracted and drawn on the original image, creating a
clear visual distinction of the tissue region. The next step, superpixel segmentation, uses color and texture similarity
to divide the image into smaller segments. Each segment is analyzed for purple concentration based on defined HSV color thresholds,
allowing a more consistent analysis across lighting variations. Regions with high staining concentration retain their original
color, moderate concentrations are marked in white, and low concentrations in black, emphasizing tissue areas by staining intensity.

Instructions for Use:

To use this code, start by organizing your images and ensuring that they are named 
and stored in a directory that matches the image path specified in the code. The 
`generate_epithelium_mask` function should be run first to generate the contour mask and
identify tissue regions. Next, run the `create_and_cut_superpixels` function with the input image,
contour mask, and the contours generated. Adjust parameters like `num_segments` for superpixel count
and `lower_purple`/`upper_purple` to refine HSV color thresholds as needed. The code will output segmented
images with regions classified by purple concentration, with the ability to visualize and quantify these staining patterns.

Limitations:

While effective for highlighting stained regions, this method has several limitations. 
The code's effectiveness relies on optimal threshold and morphological parameters, which may 
need fine-tuning across different images. Variations in lighting or staining intensity can also impact results, 
potentially requiring adjustments to color thresholds. Additionally, the current code is unfinished for outside-region
processing and is limited in handling overlapping tissue regions where superpixels may mix inside and outside regions. 
Expanding these capabilities would further enhance the toolâ€™s robustness across diverse tissue samples.
