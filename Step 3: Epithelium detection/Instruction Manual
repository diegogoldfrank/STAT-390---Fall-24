Instruction Manual for Use:

1. To use this code, start by organizing your images and ensuring that they are named 
and stored in a directory that matches the image path specified in the code. Also make sure they are in .tif format. 
2. Make sure OpenCV, NumPy, skimage, and Matplotlib are installed. 
3. Run the code.
4. Adjust parameters like `num_segments` for superpixel count and 
`lower_purple`/`upper_purple` to refine HSV color thresholds as needed. 
The code will output segmented images with regions classified by purple concentration, 
with the ability to visualize and quantify these staining patterns.
