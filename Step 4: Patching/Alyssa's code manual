Explanation
This code provides a method for segmenting and analyzing regions within a tissue sample image, 
focusing on detecting specific tissue structures and isolating regions based on color and contour characteristics. 
Initially, the code uses edge detection to identify regions and further refines this with Canny edge detection, 
isolating areas that may correspond to different tissue structures like the outer black boundary, magenta epithelium,
and inner stroma. By repeatedly sampling from different image regions, the code attempts to ensure an appropriate 
representation of these key structures within each sample. The approach also involves color-based pixel classification
to differentiate and quantify specific color regions, such as magenta for epithelium and a loose blue/indigo for stroma. 
This process culminates in visualizing segmented patches within the tissue, marked by red rectangles to indicate regions
containing these tissue characteristics. Additionally, based on feedback, the method has been adapted to apply fixed-sized boxes,
ensuring uniform sampling dimensions that align with stakeholder specifications.

Instruction Manual:
1. Setup: Ensure that OpenCV, NumPy, and Matplotlib are installed. Place the tissue image (e.g., `FinalExtraction.jpg`)
in the specified path or update the code to point to the correct image location.
2. Load Image**: The script reads the input image and converts it to an RGB format suitable for processing.
3. Run Sampling Method**: The main function, `fixed_box_epithelium_sample`, performs edge detection, classifies 
pixels by color, and defines fixed-sized sampling boxes. Customize `num_samples` for the number of samples and `box_size`
for patch dimensions if needed.
4. Generate and Display Samples**: The code identifies regions containing black (outer boundary), magenta (epithelium),
and blue/indigo (stroma) pixels, checking that each sampled region meets a minimum count threshold for these colors.
The results are displayed with red rectangles marking the extracted patches, and each individual sample is displayed separately.
5. Visualization: The script plots the main tissue image with red rectangles indicating sample locations, followed by
individual samples in a grid format.

Limitations
This method, while useful for identifying tissue regions based on color classification and edge detection,
has some limitations. Since it relies heavily on color thresholds, variations in lighting, staining, and image
quality can lead to inconsistent results or require threshold adjustments. Additionally, the classification of 
tissue structures using pixel colors may not capture subtler structural details. The fixed patch size is effective 
for consistency but may not fully accommodate regions of interest that vary in size or shape, potentially missing 
relevant details. Lastly, the method assumes specific color ranges for each tissue region, limiting its adaptability
to images with different color characteristics or staining protocols.
