Goals:

"Presentation 2 objective is to work on the shortcomings of presentation 1, which, in decreasing order of priority, are:

1) Improve epithelium detection, particularly on images not used to train your model. 
   If your model doesn't require training, it must be general, i.e., work on all images.
2) Loss in image quality may make it much harder to see / detect melanocytes, which need to 
   be analyzed later in the project. If you are losing image quality, then, if possible, try to map 
   the coordinates of the epithelium back to the raw image, so that only the part of the 
   image having the epithelium can be analyzed. Or, update your method to avoid losing image quality
   - maybe try using your python code within QuPath.
3) Export the extracted epithelium, such that the exported image can be used to take samples from. 
   Or, even better would be if you directly export samples of epithelium, instead of exporting the 
   entire epithelium.
4) Minimize human intervention required to implement your method on new images. The method has to 
   be used by doctors, who will prefer just clicking a button to get samples of epithelium.
